# Finding_Donors_For_CharityML
In this project, I employED several supervised learning algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Then I chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimized this algorithm to best model the data. The goal is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This will help a non-profit organization to better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.
## Installations
For running this project, the most important library is Python 3 version of Anaconda Distribution. It installs all necessary packages for analysis and building models.
## Introducing the datasets
The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.
